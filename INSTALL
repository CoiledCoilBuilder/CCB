* Installation

  There are two install options for usage within VMD:

** Library

*** Option A: Install to VMD's plugin location on your machine

    After downloading the appropriate shared library for your system
    (Windows, Mac OS, Linux), unpack the .zip file in your
    plugins/${ARCH}/tcl directory where ${ARCH} is WIN32, LINUXAMD64 or
    MACOSXX86. The precise location of your plugins directory may vary:

    Linux: /lib/vmd/plugins/LINUXAMD64/tcl
    MacOS: /Applications/VMD\ 1.9.1.app/Contents/vmd/plugins/MACOSXX86/tcl
    Windows: C:\Program Files (x86)\University of Illinois\VMD\plugins\WIN32\tcl


*** Option B: Install to a directory of your choosing

    After downloading the appropriate library for your system (Windows,
    Mac OS, Linux), unpack the .zip file to the directory of your choice
    (vmdplugins, for example). Then edit your vmd start-up file:

    For Linux and MacOS add the following to $HOME/.vmdrc:

    set auto_path [linsert $auto_path 0 [file join $env(HOME) vmdplugins]]

    For Windows add the following to %USERPROFILE%/vmd.rc
    (%USERPROFILE%, at least in Windows XP, is C:\Documents and
    Settings\User; you can also just use %USERPROFILE% in Windows
    Explorer):

    set auto_path [linsert $auto_path 0 {C:\vmdplugins}]

** Compiling on Linux, MacOS, cross-compile for Windows

   CCB requires at the minimum a compiler such as gcc or clang. To use
   the tcl interface, tcl headers/libraries are required. These are
   usually available via your distributions package manager, e.g. yum
   install tcl-devel or apt-get install tcl8.5-dev.

   You can download directly or clone the source code from github using
   git: git clone git@github.com:chrismacdermaid/ccb.git change to the
   newly created ccb directory and issue the appropriate make command:

   cd git
   make archive-LINUXAMD64

   or for MacOS
   make archive-MACOSXX86

   Windows binaries/libraries can be compiled using the MinGW cross-compiler on linux:
   make archive-WIN32

   After compilation, use the created archive (ccb1.0_LINUXAMD64.zip, for
   example) and complete the library installation instructions above.

   Issuing make will provide you with additional options and
   architectures such as 64-bit windows and OSX libraries.
