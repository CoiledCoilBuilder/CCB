To use the VMD plugin that accepts the atomselect directly, e.g. 

vmd > ccb -sel $sel -pitch 1000 -radius 10

you need to create two symbolic links in this directory:

srcinc -> /path/to/vmd-source-code-directory
include -> /path/to/lib/vmd/plugins/include

on my machine:

[macdercm@MinasTirith:~/projects/ccb/src/USER-VMD] VMD(+6/-65)+* Â± lt
lrwxrwxrwx 1 macdercm macdercm   36 2013-04-26 14:42 srcinc -> /home/macdercm/compile/vmd-1.9.1/src
lrwxrwxrwx 1 macdercm macdercm   42 2013-04-26 14:43 include -> /home/macdercm/pkg/lib/vmd/plugins/include

then, proceed as normal;

make no-user-tcl
make yes-user-vmd
make makeshlib && make -f Makefile.shlib linux64 
cp libccb_ubuntu64.so ~/.vmdplugins/ccb/.

the user-vmd package should still behave as the user-tcl package
did. We retain user-tcl for convenience.
