The offical CCB page is located [Here](https://sites.google.com/site/chrismacdermaid/odds-and-ends/coiled-coil-builder)

Coiled-Coil Builder generates all-atom backbone structures by manipulating their topologies via the well known Crick parameters. Both a command line utility and GUI are available. The GUI is available as a VMD TK plugin. The source code is licensed under the GPLv3, and can be compiled as a stand-alone executable, static, or shared library for easy incorporation into existing projects on many popular platforms. Shared libraries are currently available for download for Windows, Mac OS and Linux which can be loaded into a TCL interpreter for easy scripting and extending.
